### QuoridorPOOB
[`QuoriPOOB`](https://github.com/MIGUEL-MOTTA-U/POOB_DANIEL_MIGUEL/tree/main/FINAL/Quoridor) is the final project of the course. It is a two-player strategy game developed using object-oriented programming principles in Java. This project encompasses everything learned throughout the course, from the implementation of inheritance and interfaces to software design patterns.

The QuoriPOOB game builds upon the traditional Quoridor game by introducing new game modes based on time constraints, implementing machines with varying difficulty levels, offering options to save and load games, and featuring different types of squares and walls. Any errors encountered by the user are automatically logged in a `Game.log` file.

The design for the project, along with the code and the portable component of the program, follows layered design standards and programming practices.
