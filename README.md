# Object-Oriented Programming

This repository contains the materials and projects for the "Object-Oriented Programming" course. Here you will find hands-on exercises, workshops, and projects covering the fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming in Java. The topics covered range from object-oriented programming best practices to software patterns.

## Contents

### Labs
The [`LABS`](https://github.com/MIGUEL-MOTTA-U/POOB_DANIEL_MIGUEL/tree/main/LABS) folder contains a series of practical exercises covering topics such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and more. These exercises are designed to help you understand and apply object-oriented programming concepts in a practical way.

### Workshops
In the [`WORKSHOPS`](https://github.com/MIGUEL-MOTTA-U/POOB_DANIEL_MIGUEL/tree/main/WORKSHOPS) folder, you'll find a collection of more complex exercises that were designed to put our object-oriented programming skills into practice in more challenging contexts.

### Spider Web
The [`SPIDERWEB`](https://github.com/MIGUEL-MOTTA-U/POOB_DANIEL_MIGUEL/tree/main/SPIDERWEB) It is a project that covers the first two-thirds of the course. In this project, we apply the knowledge acquired in the initial phases of the course to develop a more complex application. We worked primarily with the BlueJ IDE to represent, through an interface, the creation of classes and objects, as well as the behavior of different types of classes and interfaces.

The project taught us the correct way to layer a project and understand the various tools that Java offers as an object-oriented programming language.

### QuoridorPOOB
[`QuoriPOOB`](https://github.com/MIGUEL-MOTTA-U/POOB_DANIEL_MIGUEL/tree/main/FINAL/Quoridor) is the final project of the course. It is a two-player strategy game developed using object-oriented programming principles in Java. This project encompasses everything learned throughout the course, from the implementation of inheritance and interfaces to software design patterns.

The QuoriPOOB game builds upon the traditional Quoridor game by introducing new game modes based on time constraints, implementing machines with varying difficulty levels, offering options to save and load games, and featuring different types of squares and walls. Any errors encountered by the user are automatically logged in a `Game.log` file.

The design for the project, along with the code and the portable component of the program, follows layered design standards and programming practices.
